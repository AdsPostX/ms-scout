# Scout — Architecture Invariants

## The Core Rule: One Function Per Signal

Scout computes signals in two places:
1. **Agent tools** (`scout_agent.py`) — called when a user asks @Scout a question
2. **Pulse signals** (`scout_bot.py` `_run_pulse_signals()`) — computed at 8am

When the same business logic exists in BOTH, they MUST call a shared `_query_*()` function.
Duplicate SQL guarantees drift. This happened with ghost detection in Apr 2026 — the Pulse
missed a 48h recency filter that was added to the agent tool, causing false alarms.

## Signal Map — Verified Apr 2026

| Signal | Shared function | Consumers | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ghost campaigns | `_query_ghost_campaigns(ch)` in `scout_agent.py` | `get_ghost_campaigns()` + Pulse `_run_pulse_signals()` | Pulse groups by adv_name; agent keeps per-campaign detail |
| Revenue opportunities | **Not yet extracted** — see note below | `get_top_revenue_opportunities()` + `_build_opportunity_signal()` | Agent has fuzzy name-matching anti-join; Pulse does not. No confirmed user-visible bug yet. |
| Fill rate | **Intentionally separate** | `get_low_fill_publishers()` (30d/10K threshold) + Pulse signal (7d/5K threshold) | Different thresholds on purpose: Pulse = early warning, Agent = stable analysis. Do not merge. |
| Velocity shifts | Pulse-only | `_build_velocity_signal()` | No agent tool — no divergence risk |
| Cap alerts | Pulse-only | `_build_cap_signal()` | No agent tool — no divergence risk |
| Overnight events | Pulse-only | `_build_overnight_signal()` | No agent tool — no divergence risk |

## Rules When Editing Signal Logic

1. **Threshold, window, or filter change** → edit the shared `_query_*()` function only, never in the caller
2. **Adding a field** → add to the shared function SELECT, then consume in both callers
3. **New Pulse signal** → check if an agent tool already computes the same thing; if yes, extract shared function first
4. **New agent tool** → check if the Pulse already computes the same thing; if yes, use or create a shared function

---

## Revenue Opportunities — Outstanding Work

`get_top_revenue_opportunities()` in `scout_agent.py` has fuzzy name-matching in its `active_pairs`
anti-join (prevents recommending "Disney+ and Hulu" when a partner already runs "Disney+").
`_build_opportunity_signal()` in `scout_bot.py` does not. No confirmed user-visible bug yet.

When this causes a bad recommendation, extract `_query_revenue_opportunities(ch)` and wire both callers to it.

## Architecture Map

```
offer_scraper.py        — Scraper: 9 networks → offers_latest.json + Notion (every 6h)
scout_agent.py          — Claude intelligence: TOOLS list, SYSTEM_PROMPT, shared _query_*() functions
scout_bot.py            — Slack: socket mode, Pulse signal builder, block_action router
scout_digest.py         — Weekly digest: scoring + dedup
context_harvester.py    — Nightly Slack context extraction
campaign_builder.py     — PARKED: Playwright automation (pending Vamsee sign-off)
```

**Knowledge stores:**
- `data/offers_latest.json` — current offer snapshot (refreshed every 6h)
- `data/entity_overrides.json` — publisher/advertiser facts Scout has learned from the team
- `data/pulse_state.json` — runtime Pulse state; never manually edit publisher names without verifying in ClickHouse
- `config/team_corrections.json` — static platform-wide facts (git-tracked), not for entity facts

## File-Editing Rules

### scout_agent.py
- **TOOLS list**: every new tool needs 4 things — `name`, `description`, `input_schema`, and a TOOL_MAP entry + function. Missing any one silently breaks routing.
- **SYSTEM_PROMPT**: add a numbered intent routing line for every new tool
- **Shared functions**: prefix with `_query_` and accept `ch` (ClickHouse client) as first arg; return plain dicts, not formatted text

### scout_bot.py
- **`_run_pulse_signals()`**: signal computation only — SQL belongs in shared `_query_*()` functions in scout_agent.py, not inline here
- **`_format_pulse_blocks()`**: rendering only — no SQL, no business logic, no thresholds
- **`_handle_block_action()`**: add `elif action_id == "..."` for each new button; always thread-dispatch heavy operations
- **`pulse_state.json`** is written by the bot at runtime — don't put static facts here

### Shared function contract
```python
def _query_ghost_campaigns(ch) -> list[dict]:
    # Returns: list of dicts with keys:
    #   campaign_id, adv_name, campaign_title,
    #   impressions_7d, impressions_2d, clicks_7d, revenue_7d,
    #   first_impression_date, publisher_ids, publisher_names
    ...
```

Always return plain Python dicts — let the caller decide how to format for Slack, Pulse display, etc.

## Known Data Quality Issues

### "Major Rocket Real Real" publisher name
- **Publisher ID**: 927 in `mv_adpx_users`
- **Status**: Genuine organization name in ClickHouse — not a Scout artifact
- **Verified**: Apr 23 2026 — 1,388 impressions in last 30 days, active publisher
- **Fix needed**: Platform ops — update organization name in the MS platform for publisher 927 to "Major Rocket" (flag for Vamsee)
- **Do not**: Edit pulse_state.json to rename this — the name comes directly from ClickHouse and will revert next Pulse run
